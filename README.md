# Protein-Digest-Web-Application-
Web Application using TurboGears to carry out in silico enzymatic digest of user provided protein sequence 
User can specity minimum and maxium peptide length, minimum and maximum molecular weight, # of missed cleavages, and specific enzyme
output is a table of peptides with their length, molecular weight, # of missed cleavages, and the amino acids to the left and right of each peptide in the protein sequence
